# Part 9

## exercises 9.1 -

exercise 9.1 = 1hr 30min
exercise 9.2 = 30min
exercise 9.3 = 30min
exercises 9.4, 9.5 = 30min
exercise 9.6 = 40min
(Trying to setup eslint but latter part causes problems with .eslintrc not seeing .tsconfig.json)
Note: managed to fix but not really sure how, possible reloading into folder then back out? or just changing to .eslintrc and not .eslintrc.cjs (module.exports = {})
exercise 9.7 = 40min
exercise 9.8 = 30min (managed to fix eslint error by changing "project": true - as this sets eslint to use the .tsconfig.json that is closest to the source files!)
exercise 9.9 = 30min (had trouble getting cors working as it would error saying it is 'any' value, but seemed to be editor not using the @types/cors straight away ?)
exercise 9.10 = 30min
exercise 9.11 = 20min (still unsure about Omit<Patient, 'ssn'>; type and mapping over the object to remove ssn in the return statement object, as it seems like you can still add an ssn or another key and typescript doenst complain that it doesn't exist in the SensitivePatientDetails object ?)
