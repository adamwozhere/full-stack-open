# Part11 - CI/CD

NOTE: for deployment, the full-stack-open-pokedex is also in a separate repo on it's own for CI/CD to work effectively.

exercise 11.1 = 1hr approx.

exercises 11.2, 11.3 = 15min

exercises 11.4 - 11.8 = 1hr 20min

exercises 11.9 - 11.14 = 3hr 45min (very difficult getting the whole process setup to work with cypress, building and deployment on Render.com with webhook)

exercise 11.15 = 40min - adding version tagging to pipeline action (quite difficult as had to try parts of exercise instructions and also action documentation)

exercises 11.16 - 11.19 = 1hr 15min (added `#skip` rule in commit message for skipping versioning, main branch protection, discord build notification, and healthcheck)
NOTE: enabled healthcheck only on deploy rather than periodic, and main branch protection does not require approval as repository owner cannot approve their own PR's
